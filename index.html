			<h1>Learning outcome/tl;dr-version/The part that which be less than 300 words</h1>
			<p>I have looked at data about political interest of Sweden, Singapore, Cyprus and New Zealand. Unsatisfied with the representation on WVS, I made <a href="piechart.html">my own tool</a> which transforms the information to pie charts. The charts have an interactive feature where specific properties are compared in a seperate bar chart.</p>
			<h1>Where should I move?</h1>
			<h4>A study on the countries available in WVS database</h4>
			<h3>The mission</h3>
			<p>I'm conceptually thinking of briefly moving to another country when I graduate. I love Sweden, but you can't live with swedish winter your whole life.<br>Therefore I would like to evaluate a couple of different living alternatives based on how they compare to Sweden in a couple of values that I value myself! For this I will try the WVS (World Values Surveys) tool for analysing nations.</p>

					<p class="bg-info"><b>1. Select wave</b> <br> WVS wants me to choose "a wave". That is what they call a time period of between 4-5 years. New terminology is thrown at me from the start. I want the newest data, so I click on 2010-2014.</p>

					<p class="bg-info"><b>2. Select nations</b> <br> Here I get a list of available countries. I would like to choose Malta, but it isn't on the list, so I compromise and selects Cyprus instead. Hopefully they are close. Singapore is also interesting, and I'm a little curious of New Zealand. And of course I want to compare it to Sweden.</p>

					<p class="bg-info"><b>5. A simple diagram</b> <br> When I look at this plot, I don't know what I'm looking at, and it stresses me. Too many colors. Too much gazing around and remembering colors. I hastens myself in finding a different view of the data.</p>

					<p class="bg-info"><b>6. Pie chart</b><br> The pie chart. Finally a familiar face! However, I can only look at one nation at a time, and a lot of space is wasted... I would want some kind of tool that shows several nations simultaneously.</p>

However a con of piecharts is that it is difficult to compare different slices of different units. Therefore I added the details-on-demand-feature with a bar chart below.</p>
